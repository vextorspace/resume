I have worked in several different industries as a software developer and have learned to learn. I can get my bearings on new problem domains very quickly, and am very good at adapting when things don't work out well.  I am also very easy to get along with and enjoy working alongside others, bringing the best out in them and myself.

I would love to work with such an interesting company to have a real impact on the world.
