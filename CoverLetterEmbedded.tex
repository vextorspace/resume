\begin{document}
I have worked in embedded software at both Raytheon and Power Control Engineering. It was by far my favorite software as it had an actual direct impact on the physical world. I have completed multiple projects and know what it takes to bring a project across the finish line and how to make sure what I have done works for the customer. I am familiar with oscilloscopes and other equipment for debugging hardware, as well as Test Driven Development for software. I can make reliable designs and look forward to working for you.
