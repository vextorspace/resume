Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
At Protocase I began as the only software developer and wrote sheet metal CAD software from scratch in under a year. This was on time and extremely successful. I leveraged this success to grow a software team of around 10 people that maintained and grew this software, to something that brings in over \$5million per year and brings in over 20\% of our new customers. This software team also created custom ERP software, automated work instruction software, and many other small packages that allowed the company to grow from \$1million per year to over \$50million per year.

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
I also served on the management team and was a guiding voice of reason when facing the challenges of 30-50\% yearly growth.

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
I love the challenge and potential of growing companies where I can have a significant impact.

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
Sincerely,

\noindent
--Douglas Ronne
