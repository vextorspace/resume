Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
At Protocase I began as the only software developer and wrote sheet metal CAD software from scratch in under a year. This was on time and extremely successful. I leveraged this success to build and lead a software team of around 10 people that maintained and grew this software. Today this software brings in over \$5million annually and accounts for over 20\% of new customer acquisitions.

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
My team also created custom ERP software to manage sales, engineering, and manufacturing processes of a  mass custom sheet metal manufacturing business with over \$50million in sales annually. In addition we created automated work instruction software which drastically reduced the engineering time in each project (on average reducing the engineering cost by about 30\%), and many other small packages that allowed the company to grow from \$1million per year to over \$50million per year.

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
I also served on the management team and was a guiding voice of reason when facing the challenges of 30-50\% yearly growth.

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
I love the challenge and potential of growing companies where I can have a significant impact.

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
Sincerely,

\noindent
--Douglas Ronne
