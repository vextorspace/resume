Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for a position with Oracle. I have used Java for 15 years and they have had a large hand in that. I would love to be part of a project to bring better electronic health records to consumers. It is a serious problem in an industry that has not modernized as it should. I have a lot of experience working with very capable people that work in an industry that hasn't changed in a long time (sheet metal manufacturing) and believe that I can leverage that experience to communicate with the stakeholders with empathy.

Thank you for considering me for your role.
\\
Sincerely,\\
--Douglas Ronne
