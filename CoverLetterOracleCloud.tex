Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for a position with Oracle. I have used Java for 15 years and they have had a large hand in that. Cloud computing is extremely central to the world as we know it now and Oracle's role is very large! I would be thrilled to have a chance to contribute to such a wonderful company. I believe I have a lot to bring, and am very easy to work with. I am insightful, good at smoothing out relationships, and have a great big picture view of things.

Thank you for considering me for your role.
\\
Sincerely,\\
--Douglas Ronne
