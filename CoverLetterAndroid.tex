Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to apply for a position with Fullstory. I have really enjoyed working with Apps, mostly in android but I have dabbled with iOs as well. I think the most important part of this process is having empathy for the customer. This either involves being the customer yourself (ie using the tools you create) or speaking with and interacting with them on a regular basis.


I did a lot of customer outreach where I would try to learn what their real problems were and how I could solve them. I have always been very empathetic to others' issues and find it easy to relate.

Thank you for considering me for your role.
\\
Sincerely,
--Douglas Ronne
