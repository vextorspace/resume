Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for a position with Canonical. I have used Ubuntu linux for decades, these days using lubuntu with the bspwm tiling window manager. I love ubuntu and would enjoy the opportunity to contribute back to it. I am very interested in getting better at Rust, and as such would be willing to take a non-senior position with the confidence that I can learn Rust quickly and earn a senior position once I am in an organization. I have been a manager and a team lead but would appreciate a chance to dig into programming in Rust.

One interesting thing I did while I was there was define common sense. I did this to try to figure out how to train it to new employees. What I came up with was: \textit{The knowledge and experience to understand what the possible unintended consequences of an action might be combined with the habit of pausing before acting to think}.

Finally, I did a lot of customer outreach where I would try to learn what their real problems were and how I could solve them. I have always been very empathetic to others' issues and find it easy to relate to them. I believe this would make me an ideal software consultant but I do not know how to find said work hence working for a consulting firm would be ideal.

Thank you for considering me for your role.
\\
Sincerely,\\
--Douglas Ronne
