Dear Hiring Manager,
  I have always enjoyed the software that had a direct impact on the physical world. My favorite project at my last job was creating a sheetmetal CAD software for designing electronic enclosures that were manufacturable at Protocase. They are a truly \textbf{Mass Custom Manufacturer} and so in addition to having to reliably model the parts themselves, I also had to model the manufacturing constraints. This took me 1 year for the first version, and it has grown over the years into something that brings in millions of dollars of revenue for Protocase each year.

I would love to continue my work in CAD and hope that I will get the chance with you!
\\
Sincerely,
--Douglas Ronne
