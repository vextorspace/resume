Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
At protocase I began as the only software developer and wrote sheet metal cad software from scratch in under a year. This was on time and very successful. I leveraged this success to grow a software team of around 10 people that maintained and grew this software to something that brings in over \$5mil per year and brings in over 20\% of our new customers. This software team also created custom ERP software, automated work instruction software, and many other small packages that allowed the company to grow from \$1mil per year to over \$50mil per year.

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
I also sat on the management team and was a guiding voice for common sense when facing the various challenges of 30-50\% yearly growth.

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent
I love the challenge and potential of small growing companies where I can have a significant impact.

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
Sincerely,

\noindent
--Douglas Ronne
